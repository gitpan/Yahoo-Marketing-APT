=head1 VERSIONING

This version of Yahoo::Marketing::APT is intended to be used with V0 of Yahoo's Marketing API.

=head1 OVERVIEW

Yahoo! Search Marketing's APT API allows you to manage your search marketing APT account in an automated fashion rather than manually.

This Yahoo::Marketing::APT module is a set of sub-classes of Yahoo::Marketing. Therefore, Yahoo::Marketing is a prerequisite of this module. And Yahoo::Marketing::APT inherits all the features from Yahoo::Marketing. see

L<http://search.cpan.org/dist/Yahoo-Marketing/>

The calls you can make to the various services are documented on YSM's Technology Solutions Portal.  See

L<http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/amp/webservices/index.html>

=head1 EXPORT

No exported functions

=head1 METHODS

There are no methods available in Yahoo::Marketing::APT directly.  All functionality is exposed by the various Service modules and complex types.

See perldoc Yahoo::Marketing::Service for service use

  # create a site

                          Yahoo::Marketing::APT::Site->new
                                                     ->name( 'my site' )

                      );

  # $site now contains the newly created site.
  # $site->ID will be set to the ID assigned to the new site.

  my $folder_service = Yahoo::Marketing::APT::FolderService->new
                                                           ->parse_config( section => 'sandbox' );
  my @responses = $folder_service->updateFolders(
                      folders => [ Yahoo::Marketing::APT::Folder->new
                                                                ->ID( '10456' )  # ID of existing folder
                                                                ->name( 'new folder name 1' )
                                   ,
                                   Yahoo::Marketing::APT::Folder->new
                                                                ->ID( '10982' )  # ID of existing folder
                                                                ->name( 'new folder name 2' )
                                   ,
                                  ] );
  my $folder1 = $responses[0]->folder;
  my $folder2 = $responses[1]->folder;


=head2 Example 3 - submitting a request for a report (from Network Services)

  my $report_service = Yahoo::Marketing::APT::ReportService->new->parse_config( section => 'sandbox' );

  # get available reports
  my @reports = $report_service->getAvailableReports();
  foreach my $report (@reports) {
      print ("context: " . $report->context . "; name: " . $report->name . "\n");
  }

  # submit the report request, we choose one report name on Account context level.
  my $report_request = Yahoo::Marketing::APT::ReportRequest->new
                                                           ->contextID( $report_service->account )
                                                           ->reportName( 'SalesCompensation' )
                                                           ->dateRange( 'Yesterday' )
                       ;
  my $report_id = $report_service->addSavedReportRequest(
      reportRequest => $report_request,
  );

  # $report_id now contains the ID for this submitted report.


=head2 Example 4 - clearing the location cache from the command line

The following code will clear the location cache from the command line on a *nix machine.

  perl -MYahoo::Marketing::APT::Service -e 'my $ysm_ws = Yahoo::Marketing::APT::Service->new->clear_cache;'

On windows, using double quotes instead of single quotes should work.

=head2 Example Config File

Config files are expected to be in YAML format.  See perldoc YAML.

default_account is optional.  If present, it will be set when a config file
is loaded B<only if an account has not already been set!>

Please note: masterAccountID is not required in Yahoo APT Web Services Request SOAP header,
so master_account entry is optional for config file in Yahoo::Marketing::APT.

=head1 DEBUGGING

If you'd like to see the SOAP requests and responses, or other debugging information available from SOAP::Lite, you can turn
it on just as you would for SOAP::Lite.  See perldoc SOAP::Trace.  As an example, if you wanted to see all trace information
available, you could add the following to whatever module or script you use Yahoo::Marketing in:

 use SOAP::Lite +trace;
